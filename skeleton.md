Name
I'm a problem solver. It's an intellectual challenge that I enjoy, new things to push me, and tech will always have new challenges.

I've done writing, music, I acheived this, and I learned this.

I want to learn. Something that is going to keep me interested for the rest of my career. I like clever puzles to keep me interested.

Skills:

Software development.

Since graduating 5 years ago: Goldsmiths, self study, Makers.

Example projects and the code for the moments where I really got something.

My focus now is on learning the following.

Communication.

Facilitating productive teamwork and making sure you understand the problem before trying to solve it (out to Polya for this one).

Pair programming and writing tests first: make sure you understand what you actually want to be doing.

Real concern with readablilty in code - understanding others' and making mine clear.

- Journalism
- Academic research paper
- Scriptwriting and script doctoring: Writing with others - pair programming and compromise
Research.

Learning quickly, discerning, plus people skills.
