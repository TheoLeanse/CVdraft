## Theo Leanse

* Learning to solve problems in practice.

I like knots: I like to cope with conceptual complexity in simple ways.

I was struck by [Rich Hickey's thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) on problem solving as a practicable skill, and his recommendation of George Polya's 'How to Solve It'.

I am focused on practicing how to approach a problem, how to break it down into smaller parts, how to simplify something complex. Approach, BDD, Design Patterns (and Anti-Patterns), Evidence?

* I think my greatest value is in my experience (ie having learned from perspective and variety, learning different things, understanding different approaches) and self-motivation and self-discipline of a seasoned freelancer.

* I am incredibly excited by code. I take great care in the code I write and I want to become a bloody good developer. My dream job.

## Skills

#### Software development

From a crash course in computation at Goldsmiths to self teaching and MOOC study ([MIT's amazing intro](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-5), [Harvard's great foundation](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)), to decision to go for the Makers Academy bootcamp, which teaches Ruby, Javascript, plus Git and a strong emphasis on BDD methodology.

**Example projects:**

Project name | What I learned | Clicking moment
--- | --- | ---
Thermostat | Full stack JS (Express, maybe exendable to React?) deployed to Heroku | Major clicking moment with Express with Thermostat - when trying to use body parser and sessions (having to save the sessions).
Clojure Markov | Clojure | Clojure with Twitter Markov generator (begun at the London Clojure Dojo). Got into Clojure while working at Signal.
Pairing Matrix | Ruby on Rails, maybe extendable with SASS | Rails ActiveRecord clicked finally with Pairing Matrix. Specific bit.
Gill and Gill Website | SASS styling, deployed with Middleman | Styling clicked with Gill and Gill, a project made for my buddy.
JS exercises | JavaScript language fundamentals and design principles | JS basics clicked with working through little exercises and codewars.
Detour | Ruby on Rails API and app logic querying a PSQL db, with a mobile app for iOS and Android built in Ionic | Git workflow clicked with Final Project. shopt -s dotglob nullglob
Takeaway Challenge | Ruby language and design principles | Design principles clicked with takeaway (the one where Sam gave good feedback)

**What I want to improve:**

- JavaScript: Promises, ECMAScript 6, ...
- Networking
- Software Virtualization, Containers and Docker
- Design Patterns and Anti-Patterns. Principles.
- Functional programming to make me better at programming
- Building UI with ClojureScript and React with EMACS, to be as hipster as possible.

#### Communicating with clarity

A background in journalism, scriptwriting and an essay-based academic subject. Has been great preparation; emphasising clarity and rigour in the approach to a problem. Really amazing way to practice clarity of thought.

- From [writing about computers](http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2014/12/05/theo-leanse/at-the-computer-farm) to [writing about a Welsh mine](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f849863c-1a86-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996.html), plus [live music reviews](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/05/sbtrkt-live-review-academy-brixton-more-sum-parts) and [corporate reporting](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/38d29230-ced2-11e4-893d-00144feab7de.html#axzz3kfONyBM1), for papers like the Financial Times, The Observer, The London Review of Books
- I love communicating information in writing for the same reason I love pair programming and writing tests: over time it is a practice that forces you to understand the problem and consider your approach before you get stuck in.
- Script reports and research projects for Film production projects. Script reporting. Also presentation of research finding, which, in fact...

#### Targeting research

Through research projects, I've spent a good chunk of my working life googling for a living, as well as learning how to have good phone calls and deal with publicity departments.

- Academic research paper researching and unpicking (I've always been very proud of my 78%, on Ezra Pound's Cantos (favourite bit is "The ant’s a centaur in his dragon world." or "What thou lovest well is thy true heritage /
What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee") and James Joyce's Finnegans Wake ["the book the web was invented for"](http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations)))
- Tracking down Dusty Springfield's backing musicians in Nashville and Memphis for a forthcoming biopic - talking for hours with the men who made [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjydOI4MEIw)
- Editorial Intern, googling for a living, plus phoning people up.
- Documentary filmmaking, going out and talking to people. Finding stories and interviewees, and then going out and making them happen / talking to people.
- As a buyer for the best record shop in the world, I had to know what I was talking about, and continually research new releases, obscure old music. A [video](https://vimeo.com/67873092) and a [podcast](http://www.thevinylfactory.com/vinyl-factory-releases/listen-to-a-new-vinyl-only-mix-from-legendary-uk-label-soul-jazz-records/) to give a sense of this.
