## Theo Leanse

Junior developer in love with simple solutions to meaty problems, applying Design Patterns and Anti-Patterns, the lessons from George Polya's 'How to Solve It', and the metholodologes of TDD and BDD.

Having learned from perspective and variety of professional experience, I'm quick to learn and adapt to different approaches, combining the self-motivation and self-discipline of a seasoned freelancer with the communication and compromise of a teamwork evangelist.

I take real care in the code I write and I want to become a bloody good developer.

## Skills:

### Software development

Over the past 5 years I've gone from gentle, self-directed study (including [MIT's amazing intro](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-5) and [Harvard's great foundation](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)), to the intensity of the Makers Academy bootcamp. I'm now eager to work across the stack.

**Example projects:**

Project name | What I learned | Clicking moment
--- | --- | ---
[Thermostat](https://github.com/TheoLeanse/simple-express-thermostat) | Full stack JS (Express, maybe exendable to React?) deployed to Heroku | Major clicking moment with Express with Thermostat - when trying to use body parser and sessions (having to save the sessions).
Clojure Markov | Clojure | Clojure with Twitter Markov generator (begun at the London Clojure Dojo). Got into Clojure while working at Signal.
Pairing Matrix | Ruby on Rails, maybe extendable with SASS | Rails ActiveRecord clicked finally with Pairing Matrix. Specific bit.
[Gill and Gill Website](https://github.com/TheoLeanse/gillgill) | SASS styling, deployed with Middleman | Styling clicked with Gill and Gill, a project made for my buddy.
Detour | Ruby on Rails API and app logic querying a PSQL db, with a mobile app for iOS and Android built in Ionic | Git workflow clicked with Final Project. And some mad shell commands: shopt -s dotglob nullglob
[Takeaway Challenge](https://github.com/TheoLeanse/takeaway-challenge) | Ruby language and design principles | Design principles clicked with takeaway (the one where Sam gave good feedback)

**What I want to improve:**

- JavaScript: Promises, ECMAScript 6, functional JS
- Firm understanding of the networking under the hood
- Software Virtualization, Containers and Docker
- Building UI with ClojureScript and React with EMACS editor (to be as hip as possible).

### Communicating with clarity

A background in journalism, scriptwriting and an essay-based academic subject is great preparation for programming. I practice clear thinking and rigour in the approach to a problem.

- From [writing about computers](http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2014/12/05/theo-leanse/at-the-computer-farm) to [writing about a Welsh mine](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f849863c-1a86-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996.html), plus [live music reviews](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/05/sbtrkt-live-review-academy-brixton-more-sum-parts) and [corporate reporting](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/38d29230-ced2-11e4-893d-00144feab7de.html#axzz3kfONyBM1), for papers like the Financial Times, The Observer, The London Review of Books
- I love communicating information in writing for the same reason I love pair programming and writing tests: over time it is a practice that forces you to understand the problem and consider your approach before you get stuck in.
- Communication within teams.
- Readability
- Script reports and research projects for Film production projects. Script reporting. Also presentation of research finding, which, in fact...


### Efficient research

I've already spent a good chunk of my working life googling for a living, and I think that may continue.

- I've always been very proud of the 78% receivied for my dissertaion researching and unpicking Ezra Pound's Cantos (fav line: "The antâ€™s a centaur in his dragon world.") and James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (["the book the web was invented for"](http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations)).
- Tracking down Dusty Springfield's backing musicians in Nashville and Memphis for a forthcoming biopic - talking for hours with the men who made [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjydOI4MEIw)
- I've researched and made documentary films about computers, record dealers and italo-disco musicians, which taught me how to going out and talking to people. Finding stories and interviewees, and then going out and making them happen / talking to people.
- As a buyer for the best record shop in the world, I had to know what I was talking about, and continually research new releases, obscure old music. A [video](https://vimeo.com/67873092) and a [podcast](http://www.thevinylfactory.com/vinyl-factory-releases/listen-to-a-new-vinyl-only-mix-from-legendary-uk-label-soul-jazz-records/) to give a sense of this.
